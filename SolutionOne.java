//  SEAT METHOD:
/* Summarize:
*  We are given an array that has values. Every element will appear twice except one value.
*  Requires O(n) runtime and O(1) space complexity.
*/

/* Examples
*  Inputs: [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4]
*  Output: 2
*
* (If there is only one item in the array)
* Inputs: [1]
* Outputs: 1
